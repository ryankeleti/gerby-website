  <h2>Overview of the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr></h2>
  <p><em>This page is mostly unmodified from the <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/api">Stacks Project's API page</a></em>.
  <p>It is possible to query this project yourself through an <abbr>API</abbr>. This way you don't have to scrape the information from the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> pages and it is consistent with our goal that the content of this project be as open as possible (thanks, Stacks Project!).
  <p>Several applications:
  <ul>
    <li>developing smartphone apps / mobile versions of the Stacks website;
    <li>extracting meta-information about the Stacks project;
    <!--<li>creating your own graphs;-->
    <li>... (please make suggestions!)
  </ul>
  <p>If you intend to use this <abbr>API</abbr>, please contact the Stacks Project at <a href="mailto:stacks.project@gmail.com">stacks.project@gmail.com</a>. <strong>This interface is not stable, please get in touch to discuss this with us</strong>.
  <p>The current <abbr>API</abbr> has less features than the previous one. If this causes problems, please get in touch. We intend to improve it over time.

  <h2>Statements</h2>
  <p>There are two different possibilities to get the statement of a tag (from the Stacks Project for now),
  <ol>
    <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <em>without</em> proof:
      <pre><code>https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/data/tag/&lsaquo;<em>tag</em>&rsaquo;/content/statement</code></pre>
      <p>example: <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/data/tag/015I/content/statement"><abbr>HTML</abbr> statement for tag <span class="tag">015I</span></a>

    <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <em>with</em> proof:
      <pre><code>https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/data/tag/&lsaquo;<em>tag</em>&rsaquo;/content/full</code></pre>
      <p>example: <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/data/tag/015I/content/full"><abbr>HTML</abbr> statement (with proof) for tag <span class="tag">015I</span></a>
  </ol>
  <p>Because the mathematics is parsed by MathJax, the <abbr>HTML</abbr> output contains raw LaTeX math. It is up to the user to handle this (e.g. either use MathJax, or some image generation tool).
  <p>Previously it was also possible to get the TeX code of a tag. This is not possible at the moment, but if necessary we can implement this again.
